# ByBer Analysis
My analysis on the ByBer Data.

# Overview of Project
The data provided to me in 2 separate csv files, represents a raw information of 3 types of city that are rural, suburban, and urban. In another csv file, we have the details of any rides with its date, fare, ride id and its exact city.

#Purpose
To help V. Isualize to simply understand the provided data, and giving him elements to make the right decision on how to manage the spread of drivers around the city and increase profits in areas where the demand is high than offer and vice versa  
# Analysis and Challenges
Many pandas and jupyter notebook functions did not work well when running my code until I've 	updated my material version.
# Results
•	The total fares in urban cities for the month of January is about 8.5 and 2.3 times the rural and suburban cities fare amount, respectively. 
•	The total fares in urban cities for the month of February is about 6 and 2 times the rural and suburban cities fare amount, respectively.
•	The total fares in urban cities for the month of March is about 11 and 3 times the rural and suburban cities fare amount, respectively.
•	The total fares in urban cities for the month of April is about 5 and 2.5 times the rural and suburban cities fare amount respectively.
# Summary
-Depends on the competitions on urban cities, I would recommend the CEO to enforce the number of drivers in suburban and rural cities.
-Create new costumers in all type of cities, and enhancing the quality of service, and targeting elderly people, school kids, making business contract with social services agencies… 
-Improve technology in a way to make easy the use of requesting driver using a smart phone, and this could help the increase of tourists’ range request.
